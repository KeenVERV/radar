For a forward-thinking organization like Layer2State, it&#39;s crucial to continuously improve and stay informed about emerging technologies that bring tangible value. Actively pursuing innovations and regularly challenging established methods and technologies is key to remaining agile and responsive to change.</p>\\n<p>However, it’s equally important to make informed decisions about which technologies to incorporate into daily operations and ongoing projects. As we all know, no single solution is perfect or universally applicable; careful selection of tools is essential for sustainable and effective progress.</p>\\n<h3>How it is created</h3>\\n<p>The technologies featured in the Layer2State Radar are proposed by various teams, often directly linked to the challenges they encounter across different projects. Importantly, we only include technologies in the radar that we&#39;ve personally tested at least once.</p>\\n<p>Extensive discussions have been held within various expert groups to evaluate and classify each technology or innovation. The insights gained from these discussions are reflected in the most recent iteration of the technology radar, ensuring a well-considered and practical selection.</p>\\n<h3>How should it be used</h3>\\n<p>The Layer2State Radar offers a comprehensive view of technologies we believe are essential for all team members to be aware of at this time.</p>\\n<p>Its primary objective is to guide and inspire daily operations within the teams, offering valuable insights and a high-level perspective. This ensures that decisions are made with a deeper understanding of the technologies at hand, resulting in more informed and aligned choices across projects.</p>\\n<p>Additionally, we hope that developers outside of Layer2State will find inspiration in our technology overview.</p>\\n<p>The items are categorized into four quadrants, and in cases where the placement isn’t entirely clear, we select the most appropriate fit.</p>\\n<h4>The quadrants are:</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Protocols:</strong> Key protocols and standards ensuring security, decentralization, and interoperability within the network state</li>\\n<li><strong>Governance:</strong> Essential governance methods and consensus models for decentralized decision-making and transparency</li>\\n<li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Technologies and platforms for deploying and maintaining the network state&#39;s infrastructure</li>\\n<li><strong>Community:</strong> Tools and platforms for building and engaging the network state community</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Each of the items is classified in one of these rings:</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Adopt:</strong> We wholeheartedly recommend this technology. It has been extensively used in many teams\\nfor an extended period, proving its stability and utility.</li>\\n<li><strong>Trial:</strong> We have successfully implemented this technology and suggest taking a closer look at it\\nin this category. The aim here is to scrutinize these items more closely with the intention of\\nelevating them to the &#39;Adopt&#39; level.</li>\\n<li><strong>Assess:</strong> We have experimented with this technology and find it promising. We recommend\\nexploring these items when you encounter a specific need for the technology in your project.</li>\\n<li><strong>Hold:</strong> This category is somewhat unique. Unlike the others, it advises discontinuing or\\nrefraining from using certain technologies. This does not necessarily imply that they are\\ninherently bad; it often may be acceptable to use them in existing projects. However, we move\\nitems here when we believe they should no longer be employed, as we have identified better options\\nor alternatives.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Contributing</h3>\\n<p>Contributions and source code of the Layer2State Radar are on GitHub: <a target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\" href=\\"https://github.com/layer2state/radar\\">github.com/layer2state/radar</a></p>\\n"}'),r=t(390),l=()=>(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(a(),{children:(0,i.jsx)("title",{children:(0,r.Ui)("Help and About")})}),(0,i.jsx)("div",{dangerouslySetInnerHTML:{__html:s.d}})]})}},function(e){e.O(0,[888,774,179],function(){return e(e.s=6531)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
